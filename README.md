======

UniCnv is a set of two Windows text file encoding convertors - ansi2utf and utf2ansi.<br>
They are coded using Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) v.2.23 and depend on the following NSIS modules:<br>
Dialogs v.2.3 by Joel Almeida Garcia aka Lobo Lunar and<br>
Unicode v.1.0 by Aleksander Shengalts.<br>
Using recent version of NSIS should be OK.
